# PM Specify 001 Report for PM AI

Status:
- `REQUIRES_HUMAN_REVIEW`
- `development diagnostic only`
- `NOT SEALED-TEST CERTIFIED`
- `not promotable`

## Summary
`Code Monkeys PM Specify 001` is now live on the deployed Worker after a rebuild trigger. The route was source/offline complete first, then became live once Cloudflare caught up to `main`.

## What Was Delivered
- `POST /v1/pm/specify`
- PM-only authority gate
- intake-bound specification creation
- generated PM specification context
- idempotency conflict handling
- forbidden promotion-language rejection
- no plan/task/Coder/Helper generation
- no Science runtime added

## Deployment Trigger
- empty push commit: `cd0a3c44b6b4d9a2d2adcf39a4d0d2df7c9d3d9a`
- effect: Cloudflare rebuilt the connected Worker and the PM-specify route became live

## Live Result
- deployed Worker URL: `https://arqon-contextos-broker.sonarum.workers.dev`
- `no-auth` denied: PASS (`401`)
- non-PM roles denied: PASS (`403`)
- PM specify from audited PM intake: PASS (`201`)
- specification artifact created: PASS
- forbidden claims / uncertainty / source chain / share hash preserved: PASS
- duplicate PM specify idempotent: PASS (`200`)
- changed PM specify payload conflicts: PASS (`409 PM_SPECIFY_IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`)
- promotion language denied: PASS (`409 PM_SPECIFY_FORBIDDEN_CLAIM_INCLUDED`)
- no plan/tasks/Coder handoff/Helper execution generated: PASS
- no Science behavior added: PASS

## Why The Earlier Block Was Not A Code Bug
- the deployed worker had returned `404 NOT_FOUND` for `POST /v1/pm/specify`
- that was a stale deployment state, not a source issue
- the new empty push forced a rebuild and resolved it

## Evidence Files
- [CODE_MONKEYS_PM_SPECIFY_001_EVIDENCE.md](CODE_MONKEYS_PM_SPECIFY_001_EVIDENCE.md)

## PM Takeaway
- source/offline acceptance is complete
- live acceptance is now complete
- the boundary remains diagnostic only and does not authorize promotion or downstream implementation
